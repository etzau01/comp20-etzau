1. This GitHub repository will be used as a portfolio to share with employers, family members, and friends. Using GitHub is important for revision control.

3. I have grown a lot in my confidence in learning on my own and asking for help.
4. Don't reinvent the wheel, but don't always trust the wheel. 1) Recognizing after assignment 2 that I had no idea what programs like Mongo DB node.js were doing under the hood. 2) Learning about APIs and how they are so helpful to make advanced applications.

5. I would like to delve deeper into concurrency and user interfaces.
