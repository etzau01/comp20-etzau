Uh oh I realized I never did a README for this assignment

1. completed every thing but the t schedules for each stop
2. Wenlu Zhang helped me with the t stop schedules, but I still didn't get it in time
3. at least 10

When I initialized the repo for the captainslog lab, I accidently pushed changes to github for assignment 2 that I didn't want updated. Please go off of the code before the latest commit (message: "first commit")
