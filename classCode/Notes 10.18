- Only make one XMLHTTPRequest
	- Pro: Really fast (becauuse you already downloaded all the data) 
	- Con:If you only made one request, the schedule will become stale 

- When you load the page, you don't make a XMLHTTP Request. Instead, you download the data every time you click on a marker. (Click n stations, there are n GET requests. That's a lot!)
	- Pro: More accurate
	- Con: Making more requests. Most third party APIs are rate limiting

- Or make your own API key
